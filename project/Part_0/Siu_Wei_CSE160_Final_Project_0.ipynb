    "As each year progresses and people change, so do the prevalent social issues among society. However, this can be difficult to study since gathering data may require lots of interviews, questionaires, or web crawlers that are surfing various social networks. As such, one method of research could be looking at data from forums focused on social topics. At Stack Exchange, Inc., the company has 173 online communities discussing things from board game rules to coding questions. For our topic of study, which focuses on prevalent social issues, their [Interpersonal Skills](https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/) community serves as a good source of data. The members of this community post questions daily, asking about a variety social topics such as improving co-worker relations or helping a friend with depression. Each question also has different aspects: a score which designates a well-thought out question, answers, comments, date asked, etc. Using the data from the Interpersonal Skills community archive, our group hopes to answer the following research questions."

We would like to analyze this question because the answer can help us understand what common problems modern humans face.

The research question may be of interest to social science researchers, who may want to study contemporary human problems. "

The research question may be of interest to IT personnels managing the platform, who may want to ban the detected spam users."
